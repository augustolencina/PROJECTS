# PROJECTS
What I was doing.

# 1st Project
The first project, developed in HTML and JavaScript, consists of a web page in which the user has to guess a specific number that is between 1 and 100.

# 2nd Project
The second project is about a Simplified Accounting System for Customer and Receipt Management.
This accounting system, developed in C, allows for basic customer and receipt management (invoices, credit notes, debit notes, and receipts). It includes a user authentication module with differentiated roles (administrator/user) and data persistence via plain text files.

# 3rd Project
The third project is about a Library System developed in Java. It has three users, one librarian (admin) and two basic users. The librarian user can change the status (available, unavailable, reserved, borrowed) of one or more books and add new ones (maximum 10). On the other hand, basic users can view the available books, borrow one (only one loan per user) and return it.
