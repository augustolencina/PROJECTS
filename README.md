# PROJECTS
What I was doing.

# 1st Project
The first project, developed in HTML and JavaScript, consists of a web page in which the user has to guess a specific number that is between 1 and 100.

# 2nd Project
The second project is about a Simplified Accounting System for Customer and Receipt Management.
This accounting system, developed in C, allows for basic customer and receipt management (invoices, credit notes, debit notes, and receipts). It includes a user authentication module with differentiated roles (administrator/user) and data persistence via plain text files.

# 3rd Project
The third project is about a Library System
